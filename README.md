Let Mycroft speak over your Sonos system

## About
This skill takes Mycroft's answers, converts them to speech using the user's tts engine and plays them over the user's Sonos speakers. 

## Installation
This skill runs a simple python webserver that serves the sound files to the Sonos system. I don't know anything about servers, so the built in server is very bare bones and not secured at all. \
This skill depends on the "placement" value you gave your Mycroft device on home.mycroft.ai. Please be sure you name this value **exactly** like the Sonos speaker that you want Mycroft to utilize.
